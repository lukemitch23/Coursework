## Project outline
The basic thought right now is to build a form of camera auction website that will allow to use to do a multitude of things. **It must change the recommended price based on items that sell at different prices**.

## Ideas of features
* Sold prices
* Allows the user to bid on an item
* Minimum sell price
*   Maybe based on the previously sold items

## Features that need to be built
* Website with HTML and CSS
* Database of all the different cameras and sold prices
*   Perhaps look at ebay API's or database in some regard of sold information
* Some form of backend for auction features in python
* An ability to adjust based on the previosuly sold items
